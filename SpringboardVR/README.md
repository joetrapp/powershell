# PS-ImproveSBVR

This script aims to make Springboard VR better in a few ways:

* Delete savegames - Some VR games are too hard if a person starts where another left off. This aims to fix that. Games it works on:
  - Superhot VR (Non-Arcade Version)
  - GORN (WIP)

* Focus launcher/Video Reel - Declutters the launcher or Video reel if any windows are displaying over them
